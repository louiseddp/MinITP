(** Terms, context and sequents and goals

- A term is either a variable which can represent any proposition (we call them propositional variables) or a formula composed 
of an arbitrary number of implications between variables. 
For instance, A could stand for the proposition "Socrates is human", B could stand for the proposition "Socrates is mortal".
A -> B would be the proposition "If Socrates is human then Socrates is mortal"
- A context is a list of propositions that we consider as true. The context is the list of our hypothesis. 
It is often represented by the symbol Γ. 
- A sequent is a pair between the context (our hypothesis), and a term which is the conclusion. 
It is usually written A1, ..., Ak |- B
- The goal is the list of sequent that we are trying to prove *)


(** Terms : Var "A" stands for the propositional variable A. The constructor Arr is for building implications from already
given terms 

Examples : the formula (A->B)-> C would be represented as Arr (Arr (Var "A", Var "B"), Var "C").
The formula A->(B->C) would be represented as Arr (Var "A", Arr (Var "B", Var "C")) *)

type trm = Var of string | Arr of (trm*trm)

(** Contexts : on paper an arbitrary context is often represented by the variable Γ. 
As it is a list of terms, in OCaml we will use the list notation [A1; ...; An] for the sequent A1, ..., An *)

type context = trm list

(** Sequent : a sequent is a pair between a context and a term, a pair between the hypothesis and the conclusion 
Example: the sequent A -> B, A |- B  would be written ([Arr (Var "A", Var "B"); Var "A"], Var "B") *)

type sequent = context*trm

type goal = sequent list

(** A rule is composed of its premises, its side conditions and its conclusion. 
We use the notation Γ for any sequent and P for any term.
The premises are a (possibly empty) list of sequents or side conditions: if they are true, then the conclusion is also true. 
The conclusion is always a sequent.
In minimal logic, we have only three rules. 

The axiom rule has no premises but one side condition to be true : P must belong to Γ,and the conclusion is of the form :  Γ |- P 
Indeed, each time we have P among the list of our hypotheses Γ, we know that we can conclude P, we already hold it to be true.

The abstraction rule has one premise : Γ, P |- Q and one conclusion Γ |- P -> Q 
This rules says that whenever Q is true when all the terms in Γ and P are true, then, given all the proposition in Γ, 
we know that P -> Q is true

The modus ponens allows us to use the information contained in the implication.
This rule has two premises : Γ |- P-> Q and Γ |- P and one conclusion Γ |- Q. 
Whenever we have P-> Q and P, we can conclude Q (under the context Γ) 

For now, we only give the name of the rules *)

type rule = Axiom | Abstraction | ModusPonens

(** Definition of the proof term : a tree labelized by a rule.

- Empty should be used on the top of the proof tree, when we use a rule with no premise : here, there is only one such rule, the axiom rule.
- Unary should be used when the rule has one premise : here, there is only one such rule, the abstraction rule.
So, whenever we use the abstraction rule in a proof, we know that we will have to prove a new sequent.
- Binary should be used when the rule has two premises : here, there is only one such rule, the modus ponens. 
So, whenever we use the modus ponens rule, we will have to prove two remaining premises.

However, it is possible to not respect these principle and to write wrong proof trees.
They do not correspond to a valid proof in minimal logic, they are nonsense or at least they contain mistakes. 
But they will be rejected by the function `verif_proof_term`.

As an example of correct proof trees, let us represent how two proof trees would be written on paper and how it will be represented in our implementation. 
On paper, the trivial proof of A |- A would be represented as :


       A ∈ [A]
       ________(axiom)
        A |- A

In our OCaml representation, the proof term is : Empty of (([Var "A"], Var "A"), Axiom).
Indeed, as there is no sequent on top of the sequent A |- A, we use the Empty constructor of the type proof_term. 
The current sequent is ([Var "A"], Var "A") and the side condition  A ∈ [A] will be checked later in the function `verif_axiom`


Let us consider a more complex example : 
On paper, the proof of (A->B)->C, B |- C is : 

                                                B ∈ [(A->B)->C, B, A] 
                                                _____________________   (axiom)
       (A->B)->C ∈ [(A->B)->C, B]               (A->B)->C, B, A |- B
    ______________________________(axiom)       ______________________ (abstraction)      
    (A->B)->C, B |- (A-> B) -> C                (A->B)->C, B |- (A->B)
                ____________________________________________________(modus ponens)
                              (A->B)->C, B |- C
                 
                 
In OCaml, the proof term is quite long. We would use the notation P =  Arr (Arr (Var "A", Var "B"), Var "C") to 
shorten our proof term.

Binary (([P, Var "B"], Var "C"), ModusPonens, Empty (([P; Var "B"], P), Axiom), Unary (([P; Var "B"]), Arr (Var "A", Var "B")), Abstraction, Empty (([P; Var "B"; Var "A"], Var "A"), Axiom)))
