# MinITP

`MinITP` is a proof assistant dedicated to OCaml experiments about tactics.
It can also be used for pedagogic purposes: its logic is very simple (the
intuitionistic propositional logic but it will evolve) so it can be a nice introduction to proof assistants.
The code has to be well documented, so do not hesitate to give your feedbacks !

## Installation and use

To compile the program, you need to type:
```
cd src
make
```
You need a version of OCaml with `menhir` and `ocamllex`. 

Once the installation has been made, you can use the
propositional intuitionistic logic proof assistant:
`./proplog`
